# Big-Mart-Data-Challenge
This project is my attempt at solving a machine learning regression problem on the Big Mart Dataset from Analytics Vidya.
It solves the problem using Random Forest Regression using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. It achieved a Root Mean Square Error of 1221.024 which is 94 away from the top score. This could be further improved by tuning some of the regressor's parameters more.

The training and testing datasets can be downloaded from https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii

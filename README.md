# Big-Mart-Data-Challenge
This project is my attempt at solving a machine learning regression problem on the Big Mart Dataset from Analytics Vidya.
It solves the problem using Random Forest Regression optimized using a random hyperparameter search. The code was written using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment. It achieved a Root Mean Square Error of 1156.9 which is 29 away from the top leaderboard score.

The training and testing datasets can be downloaded from https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii
